This repo is my personal collection of Python practice files and notes.
It covers the core basics of Python that I’ve learned and practiced.

What’s inside?

Variables and data types, 
Loops and conditionals, 
Functions, 
Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, 
Strings, 
File handling, 
Simple OOP concepts

Why I made this?

To keep track of my Python learning, 
To have all basics in one place for revision, 
To improve my coding habits
